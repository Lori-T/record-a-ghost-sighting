    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">About the Record a ghost sighting training prototype</h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      <strong>Record a ghost sighting</strong> is an accessibility training resource created by <strong>Lori Thomson</strong>.
      It has been designed to help people learn how to find and understand accessibility issues in a fun and memorable way.
      Each page contains intentional accessibility issues that learners can identify, test and discuss.
    </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Inspiration</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This training prototype takes inspiration from Beverley Newing's
      <a href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2020/01/14/training-people-to-do-accessibility-reviews/"
         class="govuk-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
         “Record a goose sighting” accessibility exercise.

    <p class="govuk-body">
      "Record a ghost sighting" uses an adapted version of the
      <a href="https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        GOV.UK Prototype Kit
      </a>
      — but with a haunted twist.  
      The “Department for Supernatural Affairs” and its ghostly reports provide a creative backdrop for exploring
      accessibility barriers such as colour contrast, keyboard navigation, and focus order.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Purpose</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This resource is designed for workshops, self-led learning and team exercises.
      Each page intentionally fails one or more <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG 2.2 AA</abbr> criteria.
      It encourages learners to test pages using a range of tools and assistive technologies,
      and to discuss the impact of these issues on real users.
    </p>
