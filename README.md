<h1>About the Record a ghost sighting training prototype</h1>
<a href="https://ghost-sighting.lorithomson.co.uk/">Record a ghost sighting</a> is an accessibility training resource. It has been designed to help people learn how to find and understand accessibility issues in a fun and memorable way. Each page contains intentional accessibility issues that learners can identify, test and discuss.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
This training prototype takes inspiration from Beverley Newing's “Record a goose sighting” accessibility exercise. ,
"Record a ghost sighting" uses an adapted version of the GOV.UK Prototype Kit - but with a haunted twist. The “Department for Supernatural Affairs” and its ghostly reports provide a creative backdrop for exploring accessibility barriers such as colour contrast, keyboard navigation, and focus order.

<h2>Purpose</h2>
This resource is designed for workshops, self-led learning and team exercises. Each page intentionally fails one or more WCAG 2.2 AA criteria. It encourages learners to test pages using a range of tools and assistive technologies, and to discuss the impact of these issues on real users.
If you'd like to use this as a training session you can <a href ="https://ghost-sighting.lorithomson.co.uk/public/images/ghost-accessibility-exercise.pptx">download a powerpoint presentation with speaker notes for the session.</a>
